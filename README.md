# 🎯 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool for understanding and comparing different sorting algorithms through beautiful animations and real-time comparisons! 

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Prerequisites for Python Visualization

Before you compile and run the C program, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Compile and Run the C Program

Next, you need to compile and run the C program that generates the sorting data:

1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the C program:
```bash
# For Windows with MinGW:
gcc sorting_algorithms.c -o sorting_algorithms

# For Linux/Mac:
gcc sorting_algorithms.c -o sorting_algorithms
```

4. Run the compiled program:
```bash
# For Windows:
sorting_algorithms.exe

# For Linux/Mac:
./sorting_algorithms
```

This will generate several output files:
- `bubblesort_output.txt`
- `selectionsort_output.txt`
- `insertionsort_output.txt`
- `quicksort_output.txt`
- `mergesort_output.txt`
- `countingsort_output.txt`
- `radixsort_output.txt`
- `combsort_output.txt`

These files contain the step-by-step sorting data that will be used by the visualizer.

### Step 3: Run the Visualization

1. Run the main program:
```bash
python visualizer.py
```

## 🌟 Features

- 📊 Visual representation of 8 different sorting algorithms
- 🔄 Real-time animation of the sorting process
- 📈 Performance comparison between algorithms
- ⏱️ Time complexity information
- 🎨 Beautiful dark theme interface
- 📊 Side-by-side algorithm comparison
- 💫 Color-coded visualization (Red: Active, Blue: Sorted, Cyan: Unsorted, Green: Completed)

## 🔧 Supported Sorting Algorithms

1. 🫧 Bubble Sort
2. 🎯 Selection Sort
3. ↪️ Insertion Sort
4. ⚡ Quick Sort
5. 🔄 Merge Sort
6. 🔢 Counting Sort
7. 📊 Radix Sort
8. 🧮 Comb Sort

## 💻 How to Use

### Single Algorithm Visualization
1. Launch the application by running `visualizer.py`
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the radio buttons
3. When prompted, select the corresponding `*_output.txt` file generated by the C program
4. Click "Visualize" to start the animation
5. Use "Reset" to clear the visualization
6. View time complexity and actual sorting time information

### Algorithm Comparison
1. Click the "Compare" button
2. Select two different algorithms from the dropdown menus
3. Choose the corresponding output files (e.g., `bubblesort_output.txt` and `quicksort_output.txt`)
4. Watch the side-by-side comparison animation

## ⚙️ Customization

### Modifying the Input Array
In `sorting_algorithms.c`:
- Change `MAX_SIZE` to modify array size (default: 100)
- Adjust `MAX_VALUE` to change the range of random numbers
- Recompile and run after making changes

### Adjusting Animation Speed
In `visualizer.py`:
- Modify the `time.sleep()` value in the `visualize_sorting()` method
- Default is 0.1 seconds between steps

### Modifying Colors
- Update color values in the `update_plot()` method
- Current theme uses a dark background (#2E2E2E)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - Make sure you have GCC installed
   - For Windows: Install MinGW
   - For Linux: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`

2. **Missing Output Files**
   - Ensure C program has write permissions in the directory
   - Check if compilation was successful
   - Run the C program before visualization

3. **TKinter Not Found**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Linux
   ```

4. **Matplotlib Display Issues**
   - Ensure you're using a compatible backend
   - Try updating matplotlib: `pip install --upgrade matplotlib`
